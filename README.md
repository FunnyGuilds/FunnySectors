## Important note

## FAQ

#### What are the priorities for the project?

Well... We need a working demo. That is the most important thing for now. As [bopke](https://github.com/bopke) (project leader) [mentioned](https://github.com/FunnyGuilds/FunnySectors/issues/6) we need a working demo to avoid burnout.

#### What technology are you going to start with?

* Project language: [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* Test language: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
* Message broker: [Redis](https://redis.io/)
* Minecraft platform: [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/)
* Proxy: [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/)

All the technologies have been discussed [here](https://github.com/FunnyGuilds/FunnySectors/issues)

### Are you planning on adding support for XYZ?

We are planning to have a good abstraction layer so adding anything is not that hard. If you care you can create an issue. All contributions are welcome!

### Is there any way to contact you?

Yes! You can join project discord [here](https://discord.gg/CYvyq3u)




## Roadmap

- create abstraction layer for message broker, database

- create spigot "one source of truth" (Database as a way of storing players equipment)

- split map into small areas (chunks) and add a way to send player between them

- send player equipment using message broker and recive it on the other end
